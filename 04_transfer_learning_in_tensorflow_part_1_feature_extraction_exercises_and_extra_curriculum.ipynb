Build and fit a model using the same data we have here but with the MobileNetV2 architecture feature extraction ([mobilenet_v2_100_224/feature_vector](https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/mobilenet_v2_100_224/feature_vector/4)) from TensorFlow Hub, how does it perform compared to our other models?\n",
        "2. Name 3 different image classification models on TensorFlow Hub that we haven't used.\n",
        "3. Build a model to classify images of two different things you've taken photos of.\n",
        "  * You can use any feature extraction layer from TensorFlow Hub you like for this.\n",
        "  * You should aim to have at least 10 images of each class, for example to build a fridge versus oven classifier, you'll want 10 images of fridges and 10 images of ovens.\n",
